# Printing text

## Goals: 


*   Know how to use python to print strings and variables to the console line
*   Know what variables are and understand the basics of manipulating them
*   Know what functions are and understand how to implement basic ones

## Conceptual Links:

Python: [input/output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) 

## Worked Examples: 

### Printing a single string  
```python
print("Hello, world")
```

#### Printing two strings:  
```python
print("Hello", "world")
```

### Concatenating Strings
```python
print("Ada" + "Lovelace")
```
### using escape characters
[Escape sequences can be found here](https://docs.python.org/3.9/reference/lexical_analysis.html#index-16)

print('Sometimes we need to type backslash \\')
```

#### new line
```python
print("Ada\nBob\nCharlie")
```

#### tab
```python
