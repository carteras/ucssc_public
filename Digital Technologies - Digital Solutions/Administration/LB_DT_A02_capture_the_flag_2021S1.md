# What is a Capture The Flag (CTF), and why are we doing them? 

Capture the flags are an industry-standard tool for testing the knowledge and expertise of professionals. Your goal is to find the solution to that problem, commonly known as a flag. 

Flags can come in many formats. They can be a multi-choice question, a dynamic piece of code, a fixed string that may look like this lakegCTF{xxxx-xxxx} or even some random-looking keys, or maybe even a photo of a thing that needs to be verified by me! 

However, I am not a monster; the question should frame what the flag should look like, so you will know it if you find it. 

Problems can be relatively straightforward but can quickly scale into complex problems that can take a long time to deconstruct and solve.
