#### Challenge 1

Using a print statement, write the following output: 

```
> Hello, World!
```

Your output must  be exact

#### Challenge 2
I wrote this code but it isn't working. Not only fix it, but write it in the code section below!

```python
print("Programming is the best subject')
```

#### Challenge 3
I wrote this code but it doesn't work like I thought it would: 

```python 
print("Bob" + "likes" + "Icecream")
```

I really need spaces between each word. Change my code so it works and passes the test. 

#### Challenge 4

Can  you rewrite my code so it works? I need to keep the quotes around the ... err ... quote. 

```python
print(""Sometimes when I close my eyes, I can't see" - Anonymous")
```

#### Challenge 5

I've got this amazing joke and I want to make it punchy. Format it for me so it is amazing! 

```python
print("what’s the best thing about switzerland?")
print("I don’t know, but the flag is a big plus.")
```

I really want the output to look like this: 

```
> What’s the best thing about Switzerland?
> I DON’T KNOW, BUT THE FLAG IS A BIG PLUS.
```

NOTE: While you can just hardcode this. Don't.
