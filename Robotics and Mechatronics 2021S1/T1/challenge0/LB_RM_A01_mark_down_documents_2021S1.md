# Boxes and Arrows problems
## Introduction

How do software developers solve hugely complex problems? Do you think that they know everything to do with computers and programmer? Can Google answer all of your questions? 

The reality is that programming problems will likely become too complicated to solve just by looking at it. It's a common trap for novice programmers to stop the moment that they can't see an immediate solution to a problem. That is not a sustainable process. 

So, what can we do about it?
How do you solve a complex problem? You break up the complex problem into chunks. Often those chunks can be smaller problems. 

## Boxes and Processes

What are the boxes that we need to learn? Well, we probably only need to use simple boxes at the beginning of this—these boxes represent chunks, subproblems, conceptual steps, or whatever. 

How can we use boxes to describe [navigating from the teacher's chair to the door of B09](navigate_from_teacher_to_door.png)? 

The solid black dot tells us where a process starts, and the dot with a circle line around it tells us where a process ends.

## Making decisions
How do we represent a decision with boxes and arrows? Diamonds represent a decision point. Let's expand our problem to include a decision regarding [if I am sitting down or standing up](navigate_from_teacher_to_door2.png). 

## What can we do with that? 

Describe a loop
Describe branching logic 
Describe branching logic with a loop

## What if you can't solve the chunk you've identified

## Worked example
Let's expand the problem to [something that most of you haven't done before and see if it works](tricky_locks.png]

## Challenge: The human robot

You are tasked with driving a person around who can only take literal instructions. That is to say: they will do exactly what you say and only what you say, no more, no less. 
You have 5 minutes to develop a behaviour story and logic diagram that describes how somebody can walk around the room. The only tool they have for measuring distance is their hand, and they only understand simple commands (like walk forward, turn left, etc.). No compound movements like walk on a curve, etc.). Remember, there will be many obstacles to navigate the course, so be liberal with the scenarios. 

Form into a big circle and split into AB groups. The B group becomes the inside circle, and the A group is the outside. The A person has 2 minutes to discuss their behaviour documentation and get feedback from B. Then we swap. 
After 4 minutes Both A and B move one space to the left (this should make a gap of 2 people between you). We repeat this a total of 4 times. 

Test: 
Form into groups of three. 
Person 1: Is the robot – they must close their eyes and listen to the "Computer."
Person 2: The computer. They tell the "Robot" literally what the Program says to do. 
Person 3: The Program. They interpret the script as best they can and tell the Program precisely what it says.
